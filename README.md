# competitive-programming

Lately, in my university degree, I have been fascinated with the idea of communicating with computers through programming, and algorithms to solve scientific problems, varying from maths to physics, even modern computing problems, regarded as AI.

Even though we currently have the AI that does almost every coding task. All we need to do is read the code and understand the high-level idea only. However, I believe that one cannot get the right intuition through reading high-level ideas without hands out in low-level experience. 

Therefore, I created this repository, this place serves as a place for me to practice the "fundamental" competitive programming, to get low-level experience, which I hope can give me strong intuition in terms of algorithms, which will enable me to solve problems I face in the future.
